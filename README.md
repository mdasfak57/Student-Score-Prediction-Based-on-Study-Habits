# Student-Score-Prediction-Based-on-Study-Habits
This project predicts a student’s final exam score using study hours and attendance as key factors. It applies Linear Regression to model the relationship, evaluates performance with R² and Mean Absolute Error, and visualizes study habits against outcomes. The system also allows predicting new student scores based on input values.
